# interactivebrockers
The main goal of this repository is to test interactivebrockers API and see how it works  
My goals for the moment are:
* Create a hello world application
* Collect historical market data for several instruments
* create a dummy paper trading algorythm (it should by and sell at a random time). Later I will use him as a benchmark
